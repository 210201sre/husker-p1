## Getting started

Begin by cloning the repository into a desired folder

```git clone https://github.com/210201sre/husker-p1.git```

To run application locally, Loki, Grafana and FluentD agents must be started. This can be accomplished using Docker Desktop and the provided docker compose file inside the logging folder.

```
cd logging
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the agents are running, the application can be compiled as a Spring Boot application and ran using Spring Tool Suite 4. 

All features of the application are accessible via HTTP requests to a RESTful API that sends and receives JSON data.

### User features
